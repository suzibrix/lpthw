## This is exercise 7a. Welcome from VLL
# print prints a line about Mary
print ("Mary had a little lamb.")
# print prints a line about the lamb and ".format" inserts the string 'snow'
print("It's fleece was as white as {}.".format('snow'))
# print prints about Mary going everywhere
print("And everywhere that Mary went.")
# print prints "." times (*) ten (10)
print("." * 10) # what'd that do?

# 12 variables are assigned one letter at a time
end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s" 
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# watch that comma at the end. try removing it to see what happens
# first print adds together six of the twelve variables and inserts a ' '
print(end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6, end=' ')
# this last line of code adds together the last six letters without a space
print(end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12 )
