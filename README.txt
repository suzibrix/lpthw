This is the notes for Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw
Zed Shaw is not Shaw's brother from Person of Interest, though it would
be fun if he was.

This is a bedouin edition of my Python learning path. I lost my laptop 
in a fairly spectacular hardware failure.
 My backup files are missing/misplaced though I do have some notes. 

So I plan on redoing EVERYTHING I have missed so I have a complete set.
I'm not starting from the beginning but working backwards, I guess because I'm 
a masochist.

I will also inclue all notes I need for understanding Python in general. It's not just all
about Shaw's book as good as it is.

look up pyenv
Write the notes here for pyenv
check versions : pyenv versions
activate venv == will give us 3.52 but we don't need to do that. 
Refresh for future reference.
