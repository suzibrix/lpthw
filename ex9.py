# Here's some new strange stuff, remember to type it exactly.

# 'days' is probably more than just a variable.
# 'days, is assigned all seven days of the week
# I'm assuming 'days' is a tupple
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"

# 'months' is assigned all the days of the month. It might >
# be a string... or maybe '\n' is not only a newline >
# but separates strings?
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

# print prints all seven days taken from 'days'
print("Here are the days: ", days)
# print prints all seven months listed under 'months'
print("Here are the months: ", months)

# print prints a whole bunch of text between three '"'
# I'm not sure what it's called, but it seems to work kind of like 'echo'
print("""
There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
